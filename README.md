# Bilingual-Children
BERT-based Model for Classifying Suitable English Sentences for Bilingual Children

## Overview
This project aims to develop a BERT-based model to classify English sentences as suitable or unsuitable for bilingual children. The model is trained on datasets containing hate speech and offensive language, and fine-tuned to identify sentences that are appropriate for children.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required libraries:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Bilingual-Children
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the datasets by running the preprocessing scripts.
2. **Model Training**: Train the BERT-based model using the provided training scripts.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using the metrics scripts.

## Files
- `Model.ipynb`: Contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Metrics.ipynb`: Includes scripts for calculating and plotting various performance metrics.
- `Report.pdf`: A detailed report of the project, including methodology, results, and conclusions.

## Results
The model achieves high accuracy and F1 scores, making it effective in classifying sentences for bilingual children. Detailed results and performance metrics can be found in the `Metrics.ipynb` notebook and the `Report.pdf` file.
